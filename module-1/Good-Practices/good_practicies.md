1) Proper indentation:
    - because it's part of the syntax of many functions
    - because it helps to read the code

2) Tabs or spaces?
    I got used to use tabs because it's one click vs 4 clicks :) but during my first week I will retrain myself to make my code compatible with best practices.

3) Max line length:
    - Keeping within recomended line length will make review of code easier, expecially in situations where comparability analysis is required.

4) Naming convention:
    - it should be consistent accrose the programm
    - it should be as close to best practices as possible to avoid confusion of readers the code

5) String quotes:
    - there are no strict requirements but consistency accrose whole programm should be followed.

6) Proper exception handling:
    - specific exception must be mentioned, avoid using bare 'except:' clause as much as possible, it can cause unexpected errors and strugle with a programm.
