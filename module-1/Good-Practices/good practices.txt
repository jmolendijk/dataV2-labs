1) Indentation
Use 4 spaces per indentation level.

- I encountered errors while using the conditional loops in my prework and would work on improving this aspect of my coding.


Source File Encoding

2)Imports

Imports should usually be on separate lines:

Imports are always put at the top of the file, just after any module comments and docstrings, and before module globals and constants.

Imports should be grouped in the following order:

Standard library imports.
Related third party imports.
Local application/library specific imports.
You should put a blank line between each group of imports.

- Imports was an important part of the coding I have done so far and I would work on it. 

3)String Quotes

In Python, single-quoted strings and double-quoted strings are the same. This PEP does not make a recommendation for this. Pick a rule and stick to it. When a string contains single or double quote characters, however, use the other one to avoid backslashes in the string. It improves readability.

4) Pet Peeves
Avoid extraneous whitespace in the following situations:

Immediately inside parentheses, brackets or braces:

- The number of errors in the code are significantly effected by the use of the correct syntax, spaces.

5) Prescriptive: Naming Conventions
Names to Avoid
Never use the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.

In some fonts, these characters are indistinguishable from the numerals one and zero. When tempted to use 'l', use 'L' instead.

6) Variable Annotations

If an assignment has a right hand side, then the equality sign should have exactly one space on both sides:
