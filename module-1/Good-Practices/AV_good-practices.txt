I find the following good practices important to be followed throughout the duration of the bootcamp:

1. The use of lowercase when writting variable names

2. The use of lowercase and underscores to separate words in the name of functions

3. Libraries should be imported one at the time, on top, and after any module comments and doc strings and before module globals and constants

4.The use of comments should be done "wisely", making the code easier for others to understand and use (but avoiding 'obvious' inline  comments)
5. Indentation rules should also be thoughtfully followed.
6. Nested loops are to be used with caution to avoid adding unnecessary complexity to the code.

7.Git commit comments should be short and meaningful allowing the users to be aware of the changes made.
