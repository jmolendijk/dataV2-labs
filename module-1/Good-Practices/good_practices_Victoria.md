	•	Variable naming.
Use lowercase, with words separated by underscores. Code should be readable and variables are understandable, full and explicable as much as possible

	•	Function naming.
Also lowercase with words separated by underscores, also readable, clearly defined (Basically the same rules as for variables)

	•	Libraries.
New modules and packages (including third party frameworks) should be written to standards. If an existing library has a different style, internal consistency is preferred

	•	Community conventions.
Make a code readable. Add clear lines to separate blocks of code logically. Write comments after «#» sign to help others understand the code

	•	Other (git, ...)
Working with git hub put a note describing what you have amended in the code
