I commit to uphold the folliwing Good Practices during the bootcamp:

1. Varibale namings
   - use lowercase for naming styles
   - do not use the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 
     'O' (uppercase letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names
   - avoid using global variables, e.g. inside a function

2. Function Naming
   - Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores.
     Variable names follow the same convention as function names


3. Libraries
   - imports are always put at the top of the file, just after module comments and docstrings, 
     and before module globals and constants. 
   - import libraries one at a time, unless they are part of from...import statement, for example:
     	import os
     	import sys
     	from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
     and not 
	import os, sys 

4. Community conventions
   - comment each block of code, e.g 'create a function that does xxxx'
   - use inline comments sparingly
   - write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods 
   - follow the identation rules: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#indentation
   - avoid nested loops
   - no extraneous white spaces https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#pet-peeves
   - limit length of a line to 79 characters https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length


5. Other (git. )
   - write meaningful brief comment in a git commit, for example: 
     $ git comment -m 'this must be a brief meaningful comment'
   - lower cases short descriptive branch names
