# Variable and function naming :

All names must be lowercase, and if several words, separate with underscore '_' .                                                                                                                                                                 


# Libraries : 

The Python standard library is conservative and requires limiting lines to 79 characters (and docstrings/comments to 72).
If we create a new library, then we must follow the up-to-date naming standards.


# Community conventions : 

Overall, make the code readable. Add white space to make the code more readable by other team members.
Start each block with a descriptive comment, and separate each block with 2 white spaces.


# Other (git, ...):

When working on GitHub, pull a request before editing the running code in order to seek approval of the team.
Notice changes in the 'extended description' section.
