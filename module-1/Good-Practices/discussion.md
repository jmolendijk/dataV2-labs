Topics:

1.VARIABLES

Names should be simple but related to the topic you're dealing with.
Don't start with capital letters because classes also start with capital letters.
They shouldn't bne too short, avoid using single letters and acronyms.
Avoid naming them 'key' or 'value' because it would be confusing when using dictionaries.
Don't use the word 'error' beause it could be confusing for others.

2.FUNCTIONS

Star the name with a lower case and separate words with underscore to improve readability. 
To avoid confusion don't use the names of existing variables in your code. 
Avoid using names that look like numbers or letter 'O' or 'I' or 'l'  or single letters because you may use them in loops.


3.LIBRARIES

Better to import them right before you need them.
Thay way you can see exactly how are you going to use them and it's easier for other to read your code.
I'ts better that each import is in a separate line, although you can use a comma when you are more specific like : from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

4. CODE LAYOUT

Line lenght : max 79 characters
Code should be readable in a responsive approach (depending on the device).
Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
When using operations try to match operators with operands so it's easier to differantiate each operation. 
Separate related functions with one space and not related functions with two spaces.
For the source file always use UTF-8 (Python3)
