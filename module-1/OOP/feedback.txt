1) I suggest an alternate way to define the variables in the code: 

hand = []
    for i in range(2):
	    random.shuffle(deck)
	    card = deck.pop()
	    if card == 11:card = "J"
	    if card == 12:card = "Q"
	    if card == 13:card = "K"
	    if card == 14:card = "A"
	    hand.append(card)
    return hand

2) Also suggested an alternative method to define the score and to deal with the output messages to be displayed the user

I received positive feedback about how I commented the important lines in y own code.
