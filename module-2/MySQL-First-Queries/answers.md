7. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 5. Give some insights.
They are most rated, so they can be most popular, i.e. most downloaded, but not for sure.  It doesn’t mean that they are the best, because rating can be both high and low.
8. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 6. Give some insights.
It doesn’t mean that these apps are most downloaded or popular. It’s just that among all they received the highest score. We don’t know anything about the number of rates, it can be very few people who rated that app. But almost all of them rated it with the highest possible score.
So I made an update and added the ordering by number of rates as well, so we have a list of best apps (that we can say for sure) - they have the highest score and they were rated most.
9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?
No repetitions! So the apps with the highest ratings are not most rated, i.e. not most downloaded or popular. So if your app is good it can be still unknown :)
10. How could you take the top 3 regarding both user ratings and number of votes?
To add them with comma, but it depends on what order you put it.
Apps with highest rating that have most number of votes:
Head Soccer
Plants vs. Zombies
Sniper 3D Assassin: Shoot to Kill Gun Game
Most rated apps with highest rating:
Facebook
Instagram
Clash of Clans

11. Do people care about the price of an app? Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?
To be honest, I don’t think we can answer the question as we don’t have the number of downloads. If we had, we could look at the percentage of paid apps among the most downloaded ones and then decide.
Most rated != most downloaded, because many people usually don’t rate.
I don’t think there is much correlation between rating and «caring» about price. 
Although, If we put it in order descending by the number of rates, we see this app on the 12th position:
Fruit Ninja Classic	1.99	698516
So many people paid the price and rated it, even though it was not free.
