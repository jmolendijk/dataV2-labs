### 10. How could you take the top 3 regarding both user ratings and number of votes?
There are different subjective ways to appraoch this, in my opinion. The first one will be to query as done in question #6. 
The second one would be to the 3 most rated apps with a users' rating greater or equal to 4.5. In this case, the 3 'best' apps are, in descending order : Instagram, Clash of Clans, Temple Run.

### 11. Do people care about the price of an app? Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?
Regarding the queries I made, I can see that :
* There are 4056 free apps and 3141 paying apps;
* The average price of a paying app is US$3.96;
* The average number of ratings for free apps is 19750 while it is 4038 for paying apps;
* The average users' rating for a free app is 3.38 while it is 3.72 for paying apps.

We can see that the offer is larger for free apps than for paying apps, but the average number of ratings for free apps is 4 to 5 times greater than for paying apps. We can already deduce that free apps are more downloaded than paying apps.
But the average users' rating is quite similar between free and paying apps.

So my conclusion is that people do care about the price of an app and are more likely to download it if the app if free.
