Expected value vs mean:

-When working with samples we talk about expected value and when we work with total populations we talk about mean.
In essence they calculate the same, but each time you take a sample and calculate the sample mean
you might get a slightly different answer. That is why we calculate the sample mean over multiple different samples
and then we take the average of all these sample means which gives us the expected value for the population mean.
In conclusion the mean (of the population) is estimated by calculating the expected value which is the average of
multiple sample means.

The problem with p-values:

-P values are easy to misinterpret. P-values merely show whether evidence against an hypothesis is weak or strong.
Also this method is not 100% foolproof there will always be a chance where the contrary is true. Meaning that we
can not 100% surely conclude that a certain hypothesis is right or wrong. We can easily fall pray to categorizing
and due to the value of a p-value say whether an effect is significant or not and out of this conclude that there
is no relation. This is a wrong and dangerous conclusion.
In conclusion, always keep the weak spots of your research and test statistics in mind and mention them.
