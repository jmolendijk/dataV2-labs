Challenge 1

A.
You get two pairs of values from 1 to 6.

B.
There is a sum of 12 possible values.

C.
The maximum value obtained is 12.


Case A:
Both values have to be a 6.

Case B:
We can only use the even numbers of both dice.
So that means only 2, 4 and 6.
This means that we can only can have a sum of mixing these numbers.

Case C:
The maximum we can roll is 6 for both of them so that means 12.



Challenge 2

A.
There 3 different figures to pick and that 4 times for the different clubs (♣), diamonds (♦), hearts (♥) and spades.

B.
That would be 13 * 4 and that would be 52.

C.
There are 4 options and 2 cards to pick so that means he has a 50% change or 1/2 change on the first try.
For the second card there is one card missing and he change increases or decreases depending on the first card. 


Case A:
There are 13 options so that means for 2 cards that would be 13 * 13 = 169.

Case B:
That means that all the cards that have a combined value of 17.

Case C:
This means that all the cards with a combined value of 7.



Challenge 3

A.
That would be 6 options so that should be 1/6.

B.
The highest score you can get is 6.

C.
The player has 6 options to throw.
The other player has also 6.
There are 36 possible options to throw combined.
6 of those are ties and the other 30 are divided by 2.
That means that Player A has 15/36 change of winning the coin.

D.
There is a range from 1 to 5 of the possible options.


Case A:
Player A has thrown the dice but we don't know what Player B did.

Case B:
It can be if both players throw 2 and 1 or both throw a 2.

Case C:
Player A plays with a 5 or 6 and Player B plays with a 1 or 2.
There is a difference of 2 or more between the dice throws.
If they both throw the same number.
