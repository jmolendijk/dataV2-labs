Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean?

Mean is the average of a certain group of values. Expected values is something that can be calculated over time.



Challenge 2: What is the "problem" in science with p-values?

The P-Values are used as a line or threshold that certain values have to pass to be considered as 'statistical significant'.
Different studies in the scientific community are presenting data that is not crossing this value as non statistical significant.
This doesn't have to be the case because even the significance may be small there is still a possibility that it has a big impact.
Scientist could possible just focus on data that has significance and because of that maybe not investigate other important data.



Challenge 3: Applying testing to a specific case: A/B testing.

I choice the Netflix example.
You could do a test where 2 (or more) group would see a array of pictures of a certain movie or tv show.
You let every user clicks on one of the 2 pictures you present of a given movie or tv show.
You make a dataset of all those choices and you can figure out which one gets chosen the most.
This would be your prefer way to show a picture for the user.
You can also store the data for every individual test subjects, for there preference when it comes to choice.
