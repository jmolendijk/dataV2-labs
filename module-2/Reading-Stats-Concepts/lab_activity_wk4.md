## Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean?

#### What is expected value ?

The mean and the expected value are so closely related they are basically the same thing. You’ll need to do this slightly differently depending on if you have a set of values, a set of probabilities, or a formula.

The basic expected value formula is the probability of an event multiplied by the amount of times the event happens:
(P(x) * n).

The formula changes slightly according to what kinds of events are happening. For most simple events, you’ll use either the Expected Value formula of a Binomial Random Variable or the Expected Value formula for Multiple Events.

Expected Value Discrete Random Variable (given a list).
Sample problem #1: The weights (X) of patients at a clinic (in pounds), are: 108, 110, 123, 134, 135, 145, 167, 187, 199. Assume one of the patients is chosen at random. What is the EV?
Step 1: Find the mean. The mean is:
108 + 110 + 123 + 134 + 135 + 145 + 167 + 187 + 199 = 145.333.
That’s it!



#### What is the mean ?

Both (with median) are measures of where the center of a data set lies (called “Central Tendency” in stats), but they are usually different numbers. 
The mean (informally, the “average“) is found by adding all of the numbers together and dividing by the number of items in the set

## Challenge 2: What is the "problem" in science with p-values?


## Challenge 3: Applying testing to a specific case: A/B testing.
