    "Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/904343/what-is-the-difference-between-average-and-expected-value\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A) The concept of expectation value or expected value may be understood from the following example. Let X represent the outcome of a roll of an unbiased six-sided die. The possible values for X are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, each having the probability of occurrence of 1/6. The expectation value (or expected value) of X is then given by\n",
    "\n",
    "(X)expected=1(1/6)+2⋅(1/6)+3⋅(1/6)+4⋅(1/6)+5⋅(1/6)+6⋅(1/6)=21/6=3.5\n",
    "Suppose that in a sequence of ten rolls of the die, if the outcomes are 5, 2, 6, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 6, 1, then the average (arithmetic mean) of the results is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "(X)average=(5+2+6+2+2+1+2+3+6+1)/10=3.0\n",
    "We say that the average value is 3.0, with the distance of 0.5 from the expectation value of 3.5. If we roll the die N times, where N is very large, then the average will converge to the expected value, i.e.,(X)average=(X)expected. This is evidently because, when N is very large each possible value of X (i.e. 1 to 6) will occur with equal probability of 1/6, turning the average to the expectation value.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Second view:  \n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction is subtle but important:\n",
    "\n",
    "The average value is a statistical generalization of multiple occurrences of an event (such as the mean time you waited at the checkout the last 10 times you went shopping, or indeed the mean time you will wait at the checkout the next 10 times you go shopping).\n",
    "The expected value refers to a single event that will happen in the future (such as the amount of time you expect to wait at the checkout the next time you go shopping - there is a 50% chance it will be longer or shorter than this). The expected value is numerically the same as the average value, but it is a prediction for a specific future occurrence rather than a generalization across multiple occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Third View:  \n",
    "\n",
    "I think to better understand a concept is good to know the motivation behind the creation of the concept. This make the concept 'alive'. There was this guy called Chevalier de Méré, a French nobleman, who brings to Pascal a problem about a game:\n",
    "\n",
    "A team plays ball such that a total of 60 points is required to win the game, and each inning counts 10 points. The stakes are 24 ducats. By some incident, they cannot finish the game when one side has 50 (team A) points and the other 30 (team B).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how should the prize be divided?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pascal starts to write to Fermat about this problem. At first, people argued that the fair way to divide would be for example the aristotle's proportional division: 50:30 or 5 to 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that didn't seem fair, because team A needed only to win one more game in comparison with team B. None of the solutions seemed fair.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Fermat and Pascal concluded something groundbreaking: to think about the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is expected to happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, Team A could win in the next game or could lose, and the next one:\n",
    "\n",
    "enter image description here\n",
    "\n",
    "So the probability of team A winning is 7/8, and the expected value of team A to receive is 7/8*24 ducats = 21 ducats. So the fair division if the game was not interrupted would be 3 ducats to team B and to team A 21 ducats. So this opened up the possibility of mathematicians predicting the future. This created industries like insurance and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well about the average there are many averages:\n",
    "\n",
    "In colloquial language, an average is a single number taken as representative of a list of numbers. Different concepts of average are used in different contexts. Often \"average\" refers to the arithmetic mean, the sum of the numbers divided by how many numbers are being averaged. In statistics, mean, median, and mode are all known as measures of central tendency, and in colloquial usage any of these might be called an average value. Source: Wikipedia\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you are talking about the arithmetic mean, I would say the arithmetic mean is not weighted by the respective probability of an event happen. You just sum all the elements and divide the sum by the total quantity. This should be the most representative number and which equilibrates your set of numbers. Also, with arithmetic mean we are not talking about the future like expected value.\n",

    "In statistical testing, the p-value[note 1] is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct.[2][3] (In the case of a composite null hypothesis, the largest such probability allowed under the null hypothesis is taken.) A very small p-value means that such an extreme observed outcome would be very unlikely under the null hypothesis. Reporting p-values of statistical tests is common practice in academic publications of many quantitative fields. Since the precise meaning of p-value is hard to grasp, misuse is widespread and has been a major topic in metascience.\n",

    "\n",
    "When researchers calculate a p-value, they’re putting to the test what’s known as the null hypothesis. First thing to know: This is not a test of the question the experimenter most desperately wants to answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say the experimenter really wants to know if eating one bar of chocolate a day leads to weight loss. To test that, they assign 50 participants to eat one bar of chocolate a day. Another 50 are commanded to abstain from the delicious stuff. Both groups are weighed before the experiment, and then after, and their average weight change is compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis is the devil’s advocate argument. It states: There is no difference in the weight loss of the chocolate eaters versus the chocolate abstainers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rejecting the null is a major hurdle scientists need to clear to prove their hypothesis. If the null stands, it means they haven’t eliminated a major alternative explanation for their results. And what is science if not a process of narrowing down explanations?\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do they rule out the null? They calculate some statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The researcher basically asks: How ridiculous would it be to believe the null hypothesis is the true answer, given the results we’re seeing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Rejecting the null is kind of like the “innocent until proven guilty” principle in court cases, Regina Nuzzo, a mathematics professor at Gallaudet University, explains. In court, you start off with the assumption that the defendant is innocent. Then you start looking at the evidence: the bloody knife with his fingerprints on it, his history of violence, eyewitness accounts. As the evidence mounts, that presumption of innocence starts to look naive. At a certain point, jurors get the feeling, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant is not innocent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Null hypothesis testing follows a similar logic: If there are huge and consistent weight differences between the chocolate eaters and chocolate abstainers, the null hypothesis — that there are no weight differences — starts to look silly. And you can reject it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be thinking: Isn’t this a pretty roundabout way to prove an experiment worked? You are correct!\n",
    "\n",
    "Rejecting the null hypothesis is indirect evidence of an experimental hypothesis. It says nothing about whether your scientific conclusion is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure, the chocolate eaters may lose some weight. But is it because of the chocolate? Maybe. Or maybe they felt extra guilty eating candy every day, and they knew they were going to be weighed by strangers wearing lab coats (weird!), so they skimped on other meals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rejecting the null doesn’t tell you anything about the mechanism by which chocolate causes weight loss. It doesn’t tell you if the experiment is well designed, or well controlled for, or if the results have been cherry-picked.\n",
    "\n",
    "It just helps you understand how rare the results are.\n",
    "\n",
    "But — and this is a tricky, tricky point — it’s not how rare the results of your experiment are. It’s how rare the results would be in the world where the null hypothesis is true. That is, it’s how rare the results would be if nothing in your experiment worked, and the difference in weight was due to random chance alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s where the p-value comes in: The p-value quantifies this rareness. It tells you how often you’d see the numerical results of an experiment — or even more extreme results — if the null hypothesis is true and there’s no difference between the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value is very small, it means the numbers would rarely (but not never!) occur by chance alone. And so, when the p is small, researchers start to think the null hypothesis looks improbable. And they take a leap to conclude “their [experimental] data are pretty unlikely to be due to random chance,” Nuzzo explains.\n",
    "\n",
    "And here’s another tricky point: Researchers can never completely rule out the null (just like jurors are not firsthand witnesses to a crime). So scientists instead pick a threshold where they feel pretty confident that they can reject the null. For many disciplines, that’s now set at less than .05.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, a p of .05 means if you ran the experiment 100 times — again, assuming the null hypothesis is true — you’d see these same numbers (or more extreme results) five times.\n",
    "\n",
    "And one last, super-thorny concept that almost everyone gets wrong: A p<.05 does not mean there’s less than a 5 percent chance your experimental results are due to random chance. It does not mean there’s only a 5 percent chance you’ve landed on a false positive. Nope. Not at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again: A p-value of less than .05 means that there is less than a 5 percent chance of seeing these results (or more extreme results), in the world where the null hypothesis is true. This sounds nitpicky, but it’s critical. It’s the misunderstanding that leads people to be unduly confident in p-values. The false-positive rate for experiments at p=.05 can be much, much higher than 5 percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "A change in the definition of statistical significance could nudge researchers into adopting more rigorous methods The biggest change the paper is advocating for is rhetorical: Results that currently meet the .05 level will be called “suggestive,” and those that reach the stricter standard of .005 will be called statistically significant.
