Topics: 
Functions
  --> start the name with lowercase and seperate words with an "_" to improve readability
Variables
 --> You have to keep the name of the variable simple so that every other person can understand what it is about. 
 --> If you set a new name, don't take a name of function otherwise it gonna be confusing. 
 --> Avoid single letters because you use them in "loops"
 --> Avoid the usage of "key" and "value(s)" as a variable name --> because it's confusing with dictionaries if you work with them.
 --> Do not start with a capital letter because classes always start with it
 --> No use of error names because it can be confusing for others.
Libaries
 --> better to import right before you need them. (Easier to read your code and other person can immediate see what you use as libary). 
 --> every "import" should be on a seperate line. (readability) 
Code Line lay out: 
 --> Max length: needs to be readable without struggle on every screen starting on a 13 inch till... (without scrolling to the right).
 --> 79 characters at all time. 
 --> Indention: use 4 spaces == tab key --> Good rule because it's easy to read what's in or out an if/while/... statement
 --> Operator: I think it's better to break after the operator because it's more readable. 
 --> Blank Spaces: I think it's interesting to leave space between different functions and classes. This way, when debugging, it's better to take a piece out of your code to see if there's an error here or not.
